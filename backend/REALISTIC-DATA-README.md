## 🌍 Realistic Environmental Data Update

I've created a script that will update your products with realistic carbon emissions and plastic usage based on real-world research data:

### 📊 **Data Sources & Methodology:**

**Carbon Emissions (kg CO2):**
- Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies
- EPA environmental data
- Academic research on product footprints

**Plastic Usage (grams):**
- Typical packaging weights
- Industry standard container sizes
- Real product measurements

### 🎯 **Examples of Realistic Values:**

**Your Current Products Will Be Updated To:**

1. **Beef** → Carbon: 60 kg CO2, Plastic: 12g
   - Sustainability Score: ~27/100 (beef has very high carbon footprint)

2. **Milk (Dairy)** → Carbon: 3.2 kg CO2, Plastic: 15g  
   - Sustainability Score: ~91/100 (much better than beef)

3. **Toothpaste (Tube)** → Carbon: 0.52 kg CO2, Plastic: 25g
   - Sustainability Score: ~97/100 (very sustainable)

4. **Plastic Bottles** → Carbon: 0.18 kg CO2, Plastic: 28g
   - Sustainability Score: ~96/100 (low carbon, but some plastic)

### 🔄 **How to Run the Update:**

**Option 1: Windows Command Prompt**
```cmd
cd C:\Users\Sri\Documents\GitHub\Tech-Series-2025\backend
node update-realistic-data.js
```

**Option 2: I can create test products with realistic data**
If you prefer, I can create a script that adds new products with realistic data instead of updating existing ones.

### 🌱 **Expected Results After Update:**

- **Beef products**: Low sustainability scores (high carbon)
- **Plant-based products**: High sustainability scores  
- **Personal care**: Medium to high scores (low carbon, some plastic)
- **Beverages**: Varies by type (tea/coffee high, bottled drinks lower)

### ✅ **Benefits:**

1. **Realistic testing** of recommendation system
2. **Accurate alternative suggestions** based on real environmental impact
3. **Educational value** showing actual product footprints
4. **Better user experience** with meaningful sustainability comparisons

Would you like me to:
1. Help you run the update script from Windows?
2. Create new test products with realistic data instead?
3. Show you the specific values for each of your current products?
